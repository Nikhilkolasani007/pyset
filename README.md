9) **Write a Python program that compares three different integers and finds the biggest of them.**

10) **Given the following list with values and keys, write a program to convert it into the form of a list of dictionaries with key-value pairs, sort on id, and print.**  
   **Input:** `input_list = ["'morning", 1, "evening", 3, "afternoon", 2]`  
   **Key List:** `key_list = ["phase", "id"]`

11) **Write a program that finds the common elements between two lists and stores them in a new list.**  
   **Input:** `[1,2,3,4,5] , [1,5,6,7,8]`  
   **Output:** `[1,5]`

12) **Write a program that checks if a given list is sorted in ascending order or not.**  
   **Input:** `[-10,2,5,6,8,90]`  
   **Output:** `'Yes, the list is sorted in ascending order'`

13) **Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each element in a list.**  
   **Input:** `[1,3,4,1,1,1,3]`  
   **Output:**  
   `Count of 1 is 4`  
   `Count of 3 is 2`  
   `Count of 4 is 1`

14) **Write a program to concatenate two given lists into a single list.**  
   **Input:** `[1,2,3], [5,6,7]`  
   **Output:** `[1,2,3,5,6,7]`

15) **Write a program that finds the largest and smallest elements in a list.**

16) **Create a program that checks if two sets have any elements in common.**

17) **Write a Python program that counts the number of occurrences of each character in a given string using a dictionary.**

18) **Create two sets and write a program to find the union, intersection, and difference between them.**

19) **Implement a function that removes a key-value pair from a dictionary.**

20) **Write a program that takes two lists and creates a dictionary based on the number of occurrences.**  
   **Input:** `[4, 6, 8, 9]`, `[4, 6, 6, 5, 8, 10, 4, 9, 8, 10, 1]`  
   **Output:** `{4: 2, 6: 2, 8: 2, 9: 1}`  
   **Explanation:** `4 occurs 2 times, 6 occurs 2 times in the second list, and so on.`

21) **Split the string "Solar System, Earth, India" into individual words and print each word in a new line.**

22) **Write a program to reverse the order of words in a sentence.**  
   **Input:** `Learning Python is Very Easy`  
   **Output:** `Easy Very is Python Learning`

23) **Write a program to reverse the internal content of each word.**  
   **Input:** `Learning Python is Very Easy`  
   **Output:** `gninraeL nohtyP si yreV ysaE`

24) **Write a program that generates an output where if there is a digit after a character, it converts the digit into the number of occurrences of the preceding character.**  
   **Input:** `a4b3c2`  
   **Output:** `aaaabbbcc`

25) **Write a program to find the number of occurrences of each character present in the given string.**  
   **Input:** `ABCABCABBCDE`  
   **Output:** `A-3, B-4, C-3, D-1, E-1`
